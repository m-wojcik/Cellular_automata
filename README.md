# Cellular_automata
A Jupyter Notebook script for working with two dimensional, two state Cellular Automata (CA).

The available features are:
- Simulating the behaviour of the CA with a given rule and initial state
- Randomly generating initial states
- Generating the rule based on a given rule number
- Generating a rule randomly from a given number of ones in the rule
- Calculating entropy of the CA 
- Calculating Langton's coefficient for a given rule
- Creating a plot of entropy as a function of Langton's coefficient 

After completing the calculations three plots are created and saved in the same folder as the script:
1. CA's evolution
2. CA's entropy 
3. Entropy as a function of Langton's coefficient

***For now the script's comments are in Polish language only***
